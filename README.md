# FoodTuck Marketplace Project

## Overview
**FoodTuck** is a QCommerce platform designed to connect local restaurants and food vendors with customers, offering a seamless and secure online food ordering experience. Over seven days, the project progressed from conceptualization to a fully functional staging deployment, incorporating robust features, dynamic components, and comprehensive testing.

## Key Highlights by Day

### **Day 1: Conceptualization and Marketplace Design**
- Defined the marketplace as a QCommerce platform for food delivery.
- **Business Goals**:
  - Empower local restaurants and vendors to expand their reach.
  - Provide customers with a convenient way to discover and order food online.
- **Data Schema Design**:
  - Entities: Food Items, Orders, Users, and Delivery Zones.
  - Relationships:
    - Users place orders referencing specific food items.
    - Delivery zones assigned to riders for fulfillment.

---

### **Day 2: Technical Planning**
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
  - Backend: Sanity CMS for content management.
  - Database: Firebase for real-time data and secure authentication.
  - APIs: ShipEngine for tracking and Stripe for payment integration.
- **API Requirements**:
  - User Management: `/register`, `/login`, `/verify-route`.
  - Product Management: `/food-items`, `/food-item/:id`.
  - Orders: `/orders` (POST), `/delivery/:id` (GET).
- **Deployment Plan**:
  - Frontend hosted on Vercel.
  - Backend on AWS Lambda with serverless architecture.

---

### **Day 3: Data Migration**
- Migrated data from Sanity CMS to Next.js using GROQ queries.
  - Example Query: `*[_type == "food"] {title, description, price, image}`.
- **Schema Definition**:
  - Fields included Title, Slug, Description, Price, and Image.
- Dynamically fetched and displayed food item data on the homepage.

---

### **Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components**
- Created dynamic food item listings using the `FoodList` component.
- **Filters and Sorting**:
  - Filters for categories (e.g., appetizers, desserts) and price ranges.
  - Sorting options for price (low to high, high to low) and popularity.
- **Reusable Components**:
  - `FoodCard`: Displays food images, names, and prices.
  - `FilterSidebar`: For sorting and filtering food items.
  - `PaginationControls`: Efficient navigation for large datasets.

---

### **Day 5: Testing and Backend Refinement**
- **Testing Types**:
  - Functional Testing: Verified workflows for listings, cart, and APIs.
  - Performance Testing: Analyzed responsiveness with Lighthouse.
  - Security Testing: Validated input fields, API keys, and HTTPS.
- Documented results in a **CSV-based testing report**, covering scenarios, expected outcomes, and resolutions.

---

### **Day 6: Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup**
- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - Hosted on Vercel with GitHub integration for CI/CD.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Configured `.env` for sensitive data like API keys.
  - Example:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
    SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_key
    ```
- **Staging Testing**:
  - Functional: Verified listings, cart, and checkout.
  - Performance: Assessed speed with GTmetrix.
  - Security: Ensured HTTPS, secure API calls, and input validation.
- Documentation included deployment instructions and a structured GitHub repository.

---

### **Day 7: Live Deployment and Post-Launch**
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Stored securely in `.env` and uploaded to Vercel.
  - Regularly updated sensitive keys to maintain security.
- **SSL and HTTPS**:
  - Configured SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
  - Ensured all URLs use `https://` for user trust.
- **Codebase Security**:
  - Maintained a private repository with limited access.
  - Organized branches for staging and production.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Compressed assets and implemented lazy loading.
  - Optimized APIs for reduced response times.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Integrated Google Analytics for user behavior insights.
  - Used Sentry for error tracking and UptimeRobot for monitoring uptime.
